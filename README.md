# Common-Miner-Baseboard

The Common Miner Baseboard forms the backbone of the DUCO Miner Rack which holds the [AVR-Miners](https://github.com/Duco-Miner/AVR-Miner) & the [ESP32-Miner](https://github.com/Duco-Miner/ESP32-Miner) together. The Miner Basebaord ensures proper connectivity between the devices & is also responsible for providing consistent power supply to every board on it. The Common Miner Baseboard can be stacked on top of one another to create a pile of multiple Baseboards & Expansion Boards.

These are the KiCAD Project files for the Common-Miner-Baseboard PCB.

Please feel free to modify the design files as per your requirements. Improvements are always appreciated !!!
